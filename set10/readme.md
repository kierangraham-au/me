TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Finalised my presentation on my Data project, specifically in debt areas and organising a narrative. Figured out how to create
an API link so I could update my data everytime I opened the Pandas book. Learning to create a axvline was super important in defining cut 
off dates for presenting my data and presenting key dates.
