TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Exercise 0 took me a bit to get, I didn't understand the errors I was getting, especially when it came to the tests. I ended up giving up on exercise 3 at 4:30pm on Friday and am attempting it again on Sunday.

I wasnt able to watch the lecture before class so that explains the lack of comprehension during class.

the "str" addition to the string + number task on exercise 0 took me asking someone for help. I still didnt understand how he got the str addition, though it was shown in the lecture.

Exercise 1 made sense after debugging

Exercise 2 seemed to make sense, but I'm not sure if it worked correctly or not.

Attemping exercise 3 now, to do the logical fix it task.
I attempted it by making each of the phrases "WD-4", "No Problem" etc variables and called them after true/false definitions were reached, but I ended up passing 2/4 tests, so I deleted the code and tried again, only reaching 1/4 tests this time.

var1 = "WD-40"
    var2 = "Duct Tape"
    var3 = "No Problem"
    if moves == True:
        should_move == True
             else moves == False
        elif moves == False:
            should_move == True
            return var1
        elif moves == True:
            should_move == False
            return var2

    return None

Current attempt looks like this. I examined some other codes before leaving on Friday to get a grasp of how the right answer looked, but I'll try to figure it out myself.
There is no need to define variables in the code, as you can just return the string and it will be correct.
