TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Exercise 0 took me a bit to get, I didn't understand the errors I was getting, especially when it came to the tests. I ended up giving up on exercise 3 at 4:30pm on Friday and am attempting it again on Sunday.

I wasnt able to watch the lecture before class so that explains the lack of comprehension during class.

the "str" addition to the string + number task on exercise 0 took me asking someone for help. I still didnt understand how he got the str addition, though it was shown in the lecture.

Exercise 1 made sense after debugging

Exercise 2 seemed to make sense, but I'm not sure if it worked correctly or not.

Attemping exercise 3 now, to do the logical fix it task.
I attempted it by making each of the phrases "WD-4", "No Problem" etc variables and called them after true/false definitions were reached, but I ended up passing 2/4 tests, so I deleted the code and tried again, only reaching 1/4 tests this time.

var1 = "WD-40"
    var2 = "Duct Tape"
    var3 = "No Problem"
    if moves == True:
        should_move == True
             else moves == False
        elif moves == False:
            should_move == True
            return var1
        elif moves == True:
            should_move == False
            return var2

    return None

Current attempt looks like this. I examined some other codes before leaving on Friday to get a grasp of how the right answer looked, but I'll try to figure it out myself.
There is no need to define variables in the code, as you can just return the string and it will be correct.

Everything went smoothly until loop_1c
I tried:

for number in number_of_items:
        return symbol

I know that doesnt give the computer much but it worked for the previous question. I dont know how to call a list. 

 symbols_list = [
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
    ]
    
    return symbols_list

    I tried making a symbols list
    
    symbols_list = [
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
    ]

    for number_of_items in symbols_list:
        return symbols_list

Returning symbols 

    symbols_list = [
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
        "#",
    ]

    for number_of_items in symbols_list:
        return symbol

    return loops_1c

Another attempt 

    symbols_list = ["#"]

    final = symbols_list * number_of_items

    return symbols_list

    return loops_1c

Very confused, very frustrated

symbols_list = ["#"]

    final = symbols_list * 5
    return symbols_list

Final try

    symbols_list = number_of_items * symbol

    return symbols_list

    Gave up.

    for i in range(number_of_items):
        return symbol

    return loops_1c
